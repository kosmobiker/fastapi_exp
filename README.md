User Stories
1. Project Setup
Problem Statement: The project needs a clean and organized structure to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Possible Solution: Set up a FastAPI project with a modular structure, configure code quality tools (uv, ruff), and install necessary dependencies.

Acceptance Criteria:

Project structure follows best practices.
Dependencies are installed and documented in requirements.txt.
Code quality tools are configured and functional.
2. Database Integration (Neon Postgres)
Problem Statement: The system needs a reliable database to store features, logs, and metadata.

Possible Solution: Use Neon Postgres free tier, design a schema for features, predictions, and logs, and configure SQLAlchemy for database interactions.

Acceptance Criteria:

Database schema is designed and implemented.
SQLAlchemy is configured and tested with sample queries.
Alembic is set up for schema migrations.
3. Feature Store (Feast)
Problem Statement: The system needs a feature store to manage and retrieve precomputed features efficiently.

Possible Solution: Integrate Feast with Neon Postgres as the backend, define feature definitions, and implement APIs for feature retrieval.

Acceptance Criteria:

Feast is installed and configured with Neon Postgres.
Feature definitions are registered and retrievable via APIs.
Feature retrieval is tested with sample data.
4. ML Model Integration
Problem Statement: The system needs to load and use an XGBoost model for predictions.

Possible Solution: Train a sample XGBoost model, save it locally, and implement a service layer for model loading and inference.

Acceptance Criteria:

XGBoost model is trained and saved locally.
Service layer loads the model and performs inference.
Input validation is implemented using Pydantic models.
5. Logging and Monitoring
Problem Statement: The system needs a logging mechanism to track application behavior and errors.

Possible Solution: Integrate NewRelic free tier for logging and monitoring, and write logs directly to the Postgres database as a fallback.

Acceptance Criteria:

NewRelic is integrated and functional.
Logs are written to Postgres as a fallback mechanism.
Monitoring dashboards are accessible via NewRelic.
6. Testing
Problem Statement: The system needs comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and performance.

Possible Solution: Follow a TDD approach to write unit tests, integration tests, and load tests using pytest and locust.

Acceptance Criteria:

Unit tests cover all critical modules.
Integration tests validate API functionality.
Load tests simulate realistic traffic and measure performance.
7. Deployment
Problem Statement: The system needs to be deployable locally for testing and development.

Possible Solution: Create a Dockerfile for the FastAPI application and set up docker-compose for local deployment.

Acceptance Criteria:

Dockerfile builds the application successfully.
docker-compose sets up the application and Postgres locally.
Deployment process is documented in the README.md.
8. Optional Enhancements
Problem Statement: The system can benefit from additional features like asynchronous processing and rate limiting.

Possible Solution: Explore asynchronous processing for feature retrieval and predictions, and implement rate limiting using slowapi.

Acceptance Criteria:

Asynchronous processing is implemented and tested.
Rate limiting is functional and prevents abuse.
9. Stress Testing and Performance Measurement
Problem Statement: The system needs to handle high traffic and maintain performance under stress.

Possible Solution: Simulate stress testing using tools like Locust and measure performance metrics using NewRelic.

Acceptance Criteria:

Stress tests simulate realistic high-traffic scenarios.
Performance metrics (e.g., response time, throughput) are collected and analyzed.
NewRelic dashboards provide insights into system performance under load.
10. Data Preparation
Problem Statement: The raw dataset needs to be cleaned and split into training, validation, and testing sets for ML model training.

Possible Solution: Implement a Python script to read the dataset, clean missing or invalid data, and split it into three subsets (60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing). Store the processed data in Neon Postgres for easy access.

Acceptance Criteria:

Data is cleaned and invalid entries are handled appropriately.
Dataset is split into three subsets with the specified proportions.
Processed data is stored in Neon Postgres and accessible for further use.
